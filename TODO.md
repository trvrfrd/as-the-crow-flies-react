## todo

- accessibility!!! oops
- better focus/tab-ing behavior
- test on an actual mobile device to see if the suggestions mess with the keyboard
- actual autocomplete (rather than manually clicking the thing you want) (???)
- learn what a nautical mile is

## stretch goals

- "smart" ordering of autocomplete matches somehow
  - e.g. if you type in "New York", JFK and LGA should probably be the first matches
